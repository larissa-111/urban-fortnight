		<h2>About the Dish</h2>
		<p>
			Cebu-style pochero is also known as “pocherong Bisaya.” It has a clear, meaty broth and contains a short list of common pantry ingredients. It’s also much easier to cook, which makes it the perfect recipe to try on gloomy, lazy days. This Visayan version is closer to a hearty beef bulalo or nilaga.

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 kg beef shanks</li>
			<li>2 pcs Knorr Beef Cubes</li>
			<li>2 pcs onions, quartered</li>
			<li>6 cups water</li>
			<li>2 pcs potatoes, quartered</li>
			<li>2 pcs finger chilies</li>
			<li>¼ pc pechay, sliced</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Instructions for cooking</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Prepare the beef shanks: Add shanks into a large pot. Fill with enough water to cover the meat. Blanch over high heat. Once boiling, discard water and set shanks aside.
			</li>
			<li>
				In another pot, combine Knorr Beef Cubes, beef shanks, onions, and peppercorns. Fill pot with 6 cups water and bring to a boil. Lower heat and simmer until beef is fork-tender.
			</li>
			<li>
				Simmer until the potatoes are cooked through. Add pechay and simmer until soft.
			</li>
			<li>
				Serve hot with a side of patis, calamansi, and sliced chilies, if desired.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			<strong>Note:</strong> Make your beef pochero extra nutritious with other add-ons. Baguio beans, corn on the cob, and cabbage are traditional options.
